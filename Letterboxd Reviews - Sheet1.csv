"I have a million thoughts about it and none of them are coherent. No one else’s movies make me feel like Miyazaki movies do and I’m just so happy we got another. I avoided all trailers and reviews so I could go in totally blind, just like when I saw Spirited Away in 2002. Such a good choice. Felt like I fully left this earthly plane of existence for two hours. god damn.",positive
"a terrible theatre experience. utterly boring and pointless with no redeemable qualities whatsoever (aside from it being visually stunning). bland characters, empty symbolism with little to no meaning, and a terribly rushed ending. beyond dumbfounded that THIS is the final product. an absolute snooze fest",negative
"One of the most mesmerizing work of media I've ever seen. Jim Carrey is extraordinary, the evolution of the story, the climax, the tension, the emotions, everything flows perfectly togheter, leading in an evergreen story that will always get me on the edge of the seat. Every. Single. Time.",positive
"Honestly cannot understand why anyone loves this. This idea of existentialism has been done to death way before this movie came out and it adds absolutely nothing to the genre. About as subtle with its themes and foreshadowing as a fart in a classroom and anyone who believes wholeheartedly that Truman is “so me” and that anyone would watch your boring life, needs a reality check. If life really was a simulation for someone elses entertainment I can promise you, you would be doing something more interesting then watching this pile of shit.",negative
"Alfred Hitchcock's tale of a semi socially awkward boy, a loving and caring mother, a family owned and operated motel, a thief who stole $40,000 of cold hard cash, and a steamy shower that forever changed cinema for the better. Post coitus pillow talk. Is Sam Loomis and Dr. Loomis the same person? The way Hitch gives the middle finger to the censorship codes. Janet Leigh purrs like a kitten and is one sexy vixen. Cowboy Hitch. Has there ever been a scene in a Hitch film that Patricia Hitchcock didn't steal? Pills make you feel better. Watching Janet Leigh dress is exciting. You gotta love the musical score. It's super freaky in a super fun way. Creepy cop. Cheap newspaper. Janet Leigh's eyes. I would buy a car from California Charlie. The absolute worst time for a rainstorm. The Bates Motel scares me. The first time you see Norman Bates. Anthony Perkins is the motherfucker. Of course his role as Norman is iconic, but he's a brilliant actor. It's ludicrous he doesn't get the credit he deserves for being one of greatest actors off all-time. Norman's mannerisms. Norman's smile. Wet shoes might give you a cold if you don't take them off. Loud voices. Smart owl. Sandwiches and milk are yummy. Never trust a taxidermist. Peep hole. If you want to get rid of incriminating evidence, flush it down the toilet. The set of balls Hitch had to pull off the Shower Scene. Imagine being at the cinema in 1960 and seeing that? The irony of Norman washing his bloody hands. Sometimes it pays to have a big trunk. Cars sink in water. Lovely Lila. Arbogast should be on season 2 of True Detective. Norman's wardrobe. You would think his mother dressed him? I would confess to anything if Arbogast questioned me. Imagine Trick-or-Treating at the Bates House? You don't fuck with Sheriff Chambers. Sam is the man. The way Norman puts his hands in his pockets. The importance of staircases in Hitch's films. Mrs. Bates is one fine hottie. If there's a perfect film, it could quite possibly be Psycho. The way it goes from act to act is sheer brilliance. Every scene is important. Every character matters. Alfred Hitchcock is the motherfucker and I salute him for creating one of most important films ever made. I can't recommend Psycho enough.",positive
"I hadn't seen psycho since well before I realized I was trans. I remembered the whole thing about Norman impersonating his mother and how it kind of began the whole man in a dress / ""tr*nny"" murderer trope, which is bad enough on its own. I did not however remember how directly, outwardly transphobic the ending was..... The whole speech from the psychiatrist dude talking about how a ""transvestite"" is a man who wears women's clothing for sexual pleasure and all that...... Not a vibe. The transphobia and the ablesim also go hand in hand in this film. DID, BPD, and the entire concept of mental illness definitely take each take a major beating, and even the title itself is pretty yikes. I guess I'm glad I can finally wholeheartedly shit on this movie and piss off all the film bros from a more informed position. Kinda peeved that this is still being shown in intro film classes from an uncritical perspective though. Like yeah, it's got a lot going for it in terms of style and editing and shit, but there's so many better films with all the same pros and none of those cons. Between the overt attacks on trans, disabled, and neurodivergent people, and the insidious trendsetting, this is easily one of the most dangerous films I've ever seen, second only to the likes of Triumph of the Will and The Birth of a Nation.",negative
"2001:A Space Odyssey is quite simply the worst thing to happen to cinema ever. Its forced profundity has caused millions of people all over the world to force themselves to like what is quite simply nothing more than an exercise in style. Kubrick has no idea what he is doing here. His film jumps around with little to no sense of unity. The great film makers of the world create a series of events that contain clarity of information, something Kubrick couldn't bet his life on. What is the purpose of what is going on here? Is there any coherent message? I have heard suggestions that it is Kubrick's message about the future of humanity, but what future is that? Does Kubrick even know? This is Transformers for the art house crowd. Pure style over substance. Nobody actually likes this film, they just like to be seen liking it.",negative
Unimaginably impressive and one of the finest visual spectacles in the history of the medium. A film that demonstrated the elegance and significance that may be conveyed when using space as a framework to tell a tale. A complete benchmark for all subsequent science fiction projects to follow.

"Goodfellas has been praised as one of the greatest films ever made, and it deserves every bit of its critical acclaim. Directed by Martin Scorsese, this classic mobster movie takes you on a wild ride from the 1950s to the late 80s as we follow three buddies as they embark on a life of organised crime. Robert DeNiro, Joe Pesci and Ray Liotta are perfectly cast as the trio at the heart of the movie. DeNiro is a master of his craft, quietly captivating as he conveys an almost Shakespearean sense of power and solemnity. Joe Pesci is utterly terrifying as the volatile mobster, his intensity completely gripping. This is matched by Liotta's performance as the ambitious young associate who soon finds himself out of his depth. At its heart, Goodfellas is a modern retelling of the classic gangster film, with gunfights, double crossings and booty-snatching. But what makes it great is its authentic look and feel due to the incredible attention to detail that Scorsese has applied to his direction. Nothing feels contrived, and it's easy to believe that you're experiencing the true gangster lifestyle. The level of craft and artistry present in the film is quite astonishing. Goodfellas is a masterpiece, and it stands out as one of the greatest cinematic achievements of all time. If you haven't seen it yet, it's a must-watch.",positive
"The most overrated movie of all time. The narration that begins as charming quickly becomes tiresome. Rather than letting the viewers experience the scenes as shot and interrupt the events on their own, the narrator explains in grueling detail what the audience is seeing. It creates a distracting juxtaposition of past colliding with the present that breaks immersion. It’s hard to be afraid for a character when I know they exist in the future.",negative
"A red coat. That's all it is. It's used to keep warm, a shelter against the blistering cold. Gusts of wind tatter and billow, threatening the gentle glow that results from the little red coat. In all the horror, the absolute Hell, the devastation, the inhumanity; a simple color evokes so much more than the thought of gentle compliments and a tender smile. Steven Spielberg's Schindler's List is simply one of the greatest films committed to celluloid. Bar none. No exaggeration. It is as essential, historical, vibrant, emotional, magnificent, harrowing, and impeccably orchestrated as anything that's ever been released in the cinematic medium. And like the red coat of the little girl, the film will never fade, only growing in distinct majesty and singular clarity.",positive
"A true artistic horror. Spielberg has never had anything intelligent or significant to say, and he never will. He'll continue to frame his shots very well, as he pretty much always has, but he'll be obvious to the point of insult by, say, playing a children's choir as we watch the liquidation of a ghetto, will do a close up on an oh-so-emotional face as music swells, will opt for shallow stereotypes instead of real characters with depth and realism. What's odd, to me, though, is the way that the moments so bad even his biggest fans rarely defend them - like the ""I could have saved more"" scene in this film - get waved away by those same champions. They'll say that these are mere aberrations, a very tiny turd in an otherwise pristine bowl. In truth, though, they are not mere flukes of badness. They are precipitates of the less concentrated (but still pungent and caustic) artistic lack that surrounds them - the little red coat, the stilted Neeson performance, the trite moralizing. I suspect that Spielberg will be looked upon very poorly in 4-5 decades, when his work will have to stand on its own merits instead of being buoyed by marketing and hype, but for now, I'll have to content myself with doing my part to help history's needle find the proper groove.",negative
"One of the most imaginative films in cinema history. Adolescent pains and fears manifested as a fantastical world of commerce. If you're not sobbing by the end of this, movies might not be for you.",positive
"I just can't believe how highly rated this movie is. Aside from the pretty aesthetic and animation this movie has very little upside. Sen has to be one of the most annoying characters of all time, thinking out-loud with poor and boring dialogue. The story is a shambles, confusing and just straight-up strange. It makes no sense and I wish I hadn't even watched this garbage. This belongs nowhere near the top 200 never mind the top top 20. What a waste of time, I wouldn't recommend this to anyone.",negative
"Unexpectedly phenomenal. An absurd amount of passion and heart put into a film that shouldn’t work at all but miraculously does. Something no filmmaker besdies Watiti could pull off in this way. I’d go from embarrassingly scream laughing at Hitler jumping out of a window to being on the verge of tears. A breath of fresh air for this subject matter. If there was a film that truly felt like it needed to happen in 2019, it was Jojo Rabbit.",positive
"Atrocious in every sense of the word, an illiterate naivety that is physically painful to sit through. So unbelievably imbecile, irresponsible and blind. How was something like this even considered is beyond me. A satire bluntly mistaken in everything it aims for, starting from its premise but going way further, a complete lack of taste and tact considering childhood, nazism, comedy or any other subject it might have thought to tackle. A film is not a commentary, a film is not an intention, a film is a world, form and content are indissociable. Managed to watch around an hour of it, despicable.",negative
"masterpiece. unimpeachable. an eminently watchable 3-hour epic with not a second of fat on it. wanted to rewatch this after the climax of avatar 2. haven't seen it since i was a kid, when we visited my uncle as he was putting on the second of the two-part VHS. literally all i remember is going ""wow"" and being glued to the screen, then losing my mind at the scene where the guy flips repeatedly after hitting the propeller. It's not at all surprising why this was such a success– james cameron knows how to make a movie that you have to see in a theater. that's really it. and this movie is the perfect 10 of romance and action, with a verisimilitude that makes everything so real and truly harrowing. the boat loading sequence is one of the most incredible things i've ever seen in a movie. the bombastic parts of the movie are so memorable that i totally forgot how slow and plainly stated the sinking was when it began. despite all the terror, there's also some truly hilarious stuff in here. jack and rose telling that one company bootlicker to ""shut up."" old rose rolling her eyes when she says that cal killed himself. the cut to the exploratory crew after rose tells the story of the naked drawing. god, it really is just a perfect movie",positive
"Titanic' looked so promising, but personally I would say it is the worst film ever made. Not only does it lay aside any consideration of real stories that happened on the ship, but it constructs a piece of ridiculous class-divide mush instead! Leonardo di Caprio (so excellent in Romeo + Juliet) and Kate Winslet fail to convince as Jack and Rose, a boy from steerage and a girl from first class. And Billy Zane was downright embarrassing as Rose's stuck-up fiance. There were some good performances - Kathy Bates as Molly Brown, Bernard Hill as Captain Smith, even Gloria Stuart as the elderly Rose - but they are few and far between. The biggest problem I had with the film though was the god-awful script and scenes. Corny lines ('as we walk through the valley of death'/'could you walk a little faster?'). The scene in the car where the windows mist up just at the crucial moment. The ridiculous pose at the head of the ship. And perhaps worst of all, the clean water and the fact that Winslet keeps travelling in the lift - downwards - as the ship floods. Watching 'Titanic' for me was a total waste of over 3 hours and an excruciating experience. May I never have the misfortune to see even a minute of it again.",negative
"An astonishing fictional rise-and-fall biopic where an entire life in all its complications and contradictions is expressed through a series of non-linear, subjective fragments of storytelling showmanship that simultaneously construct and deconstruct an enigmatic myth of American empire. Every time I sit down to watch this I go ""ok but is it really that good?"" and every single time I am sucked in by the form which combines expressive deep-focus images with lots of wide and low-angle compositions that take in the gorgeously-designed, idiosyncratic interior spaces (including miniatures and optical illusion set extensions) and serve to heighten the constantly overlapping sound design and montage that collapses all of the techniques (and the sense of time and space they establish) into a panoramic stream of memory. A cinematic and psychological parade of wealth, power, ego and ultimately isolation that feels like watching one big, strange funeral.",positive
"For a film that is often referred to as ""the greatest film of all time"" I've got to say this was utterly disappointing. I can appreciate aspects like the non-linear storytelling for a film from the 40's, the performances and of course, the writing (I see you, Mank) but it just lacked something and it ended up being so boring. The term overrated definitely falls short for this one.",negative

"Fucking perfect from beginning to end. Quentin Tarantino's Pulp Fiction is more than just a film, but a bona-fide landmark in cinematic history. The delirious, introspective, funny, and captivating set of characters are unhinged from any sense of convention, moving through the landscape of Tarantino's sunny little universe with wicked brutality and gorgeous fluidity. Every needle drop of groovy tunes, quick pan of the camera, and quick scrambling of the kaleidoscopic narrative all comes together in a masterpiece of profound audaciousness and sun-soaked perversity. The passion and the vibrant beauty radiates from the screen like the golden glow from Marsellus' briefcase. Tarantino's ultimate achievement and one that will continue to age like a fine wine.",positive
"As bad as I remember. In fact; worse. Quentin Tarantino's vapid mess of a follow-up swallows the novelties of Reservoir Dogs and regurgitates them into a sickening and gelatinous peak of post-modern cinema. Hailed at the time for its never-before-seen non-linear narrative (The Killing? 8½? The Conformist?) and it's original decade-long dialogue scenes (Godard?) while simultaneously being praised for its ingenious ""references"" to these very works, Pulp Fiction laid the groundwork for the immature mediocrity that Tarantino would wallow in (and somehow be eulogised for) throughout his career. Almost all iconic shots are lifted straight from better films (including that dancing scene - 8½ again... noticing a trend?). I suppose it's absolutely fine to completely rip off other films so long as they're old and foreign? Some have even tried to claim that this sort of cinematic corruption isn't ""stealing"" so long as you put your own twist on it. If by ""twist"" you mean ""diluting lines, characters, shots and entire storylines to their surface-level just to pat your self-indulgent self on the back"", then sure. Great twist. However, without this sickeningly derivative approach to film-making, the Tarantino façade collapses to expose his filmography as the shallow cinematic fan-fiction that it is. It's genuinely impressive for a film to be so long and bloated and yet totally devoid of any political, philosphical or moral discussion. That isn't to say that art that abandons emotional or intellectual engagement in order to just provide ""entertainment"" is inherently bad, but that without its crutch of relying on a back-catalogue of superior films, there is nothing to distinguish Pulp Fiction from the tide of lowest-common-denominator drivel that Hollywood has been churning out for decades. Just goes to show how dull the 90s were for this childish nonsense to have been mistaken for a modern masterpiece. It's almost impossible to point out that the film says absolutely nothing without an inevitable stampede from a herd of manchildren drooling the phrase ""that's the point!!!"". So what? That isn't and has never been a valid argument. Just because a piece of art satisfies the creator's intention, that doesn't instantly make that intention a good one. The thing is, the empty nature of the film isn't even done in a ""blank-canvass-hanging-in-the-Tate"" kind of way, as despite my perhaps harsh description, Pulp Fiction doesn't even evoke anger in me, more of a dull ache that makes me vaguely aware that I should really be doing something else. Like any other attention-seeking child, Tarantino was not content in merely receiving a writing and directing credit, and ensures that each character speaks exactly like him. It seems that Quentin struggles for originality even within the confines of his own work. Ironically, the one character that doesn't speak like Tarantino in the film, is Quentin Tarantino. For when he inevitably worms his way into a cameo role, his absurdly bad acting prevents him from achieving his 'embarrassing uncle' persona. Instead, he reverts to the child that has just learned how to swear and who's concept of ""cool"" is simply ""lots of blood and talking about drugs"". Despite all that, my points mean that Pulp Fiction does do one thing well. It is the perfect example of a piece of ""art"" exactly reflecting its creator. Loud, annoying, and just won't shut up.",negative
"Every time I watch this I have to remind myself that this is a board game adaptation. This remains my favorite pure comedy of all time. To each their own but the chemistry among the cast combined with the comedic chops of each of the performers created something special. Each time I watch I enjoy a different part best. Pretty obsessed with Tim Curry and Lesley Ann Warren this time around. Also, that ending. What I wouldn't do to be in the theaters in 1985 to experience the different endings in different screenings (alas, I was 6 years old and my parents didn't realize my developing love for film). Give this a try if you haven't seen it. I love it.",positive
"Tim Curry is funny. Madeline Kahn is funny. Michael McKean is funny. Christopher Lloyd is funny. And yet not. one. laugh, save for Kahn's desperately improvised ""flames at my face"" bit (seen by only 1/3 of the original audience). It's actually an enormous relief when purely theoretical humor emerges in the home stretch, even if Curry running frantically about like the world's first recapper only serves as a grim reminder of how deadly the first 75 minutes were at normal speed. Script is so awful it actually tranforms classic jokes into non-jokes: ""Do you like Kipling?"" ""Sure, I'll eat anything."" Murder by Death, which it rips off shamelessly, looks like freakin' Molière by comparison (and also has Truman Capote weirding it up instead of the dude from Fear and his shit-eating grin). Just dire; that it has a cult following defies comprehension.",negative
"Toy Story is a story about toys; told at a brisk pace, with memorable characters, unforgettable music and groundbreaking special effects for the ages. What a perfect theme song! Randy Newman's You've Got a Friend in Me. It fits Buzz and Woody to a tee. Andy also has a friend in both of them. The old best friend, and the new one. I love the pace. Short runtime. Simple story. Solid conclusion. Super satisfying dialogue. The effects are lights out. Pixar changed the game forever. Toy Story is 20 plus years old, but it still looks better than a lot of animated movies made today. Tom Hanks and Tim Allen are spot-on voice casting. I have a problem with some animated films, where voices don't stand out. Not only do you have Hanks and Allen, but Don Rickles, Jim Varney, Wallace Shawn, R Lee Ermey, John Ratzenberger and Annie Potts. All voices I instantly recognized, and all give it their all. I smiled at the bad kid, Sid. He makes a menacing villain. His dog, Scud is a barking delight. I love how classic movies such as: The Exorcist, The Shining, Star Wars and Apocalypse Now are all referenced during Buzz and Woody's quest to escape Sid. Plus, the freaky toys, creeped me out. Toy Story is an almost perfect family friendly film. I'm finally glad I gave it a chance. I'm sure most have seen it, but if you haven't, give it a spin!",positive
"Shocking how poorly this animation has aged, especially the human characters who look as clunky and sheened with plastic as the toys do. I suppose someone had to be at the forefront, pushing this technology forward. But also, maybe they didn't? I used to scoff at people who turned their nose up at CGI, but now in the year 2019 I think I have finally come around. I'm ready to declare computer-generated filmmaking largely a failure. Even though some of my favorite movies rely heavily or entirely on CGI (one of them was even made by Pixar Studios), I would get rid of those movies forever if it meant laying nuclear waste to all the massive, weightless, ridiculous Marvel setpieces I've sat through. If it meant digital color correction never existed. If we never got a single computer reanimated corpse shuffling around on screen. It seems like a no-brainer to me. But even if I ignored how creeped out I felt watching the movie (a tall order), I don't think I would like it anyway. It advocates a very narrow idea of child's play. Sid is the film's villain because when he plays with toys he is very destructive, offering an idea that toys are to be played with but very carefully, almost fetishistically. I think Lasseter saw where this notion was heading and tried to course-correct with Toy Story 2 by making the villain a toy collector. So between the two the series is saying you should have a certain reverence for your toys, but not Too Much reverence. But Sid is a child playing with toys! His methods are destructive, but he is still a creative child who is playing. He takes his toys apart and reassembles them in weird and monstrous ways, but they are his toys and he should be able to do that if he wants to! If that's what gives him pleasure. Given the wall-to-wall branding the movie indulges it seems to suggest that children should definitely play with their toys, but as much as possible try to keep it within the bounds defined by their very cool and smart adult corporate designers and builders. Sid's passion for tinkering might actually yield some cool skills as an adult! What the fuck is Andy gonna do? While this movie might not be directly responsible, I think Disney's status as the largest merchandising empire the world has ever known bears out this reading. At the end of the movie all the toys gang up on Sid and he starts crying and the audience is supposed to cheer. A bunch of fantastically sentient heaps of plastic traumatized a small boy! Hurray! I am maybe being too literal about all this, but I think it mostly stems from the fact that I didn't enjoy almost any of this anyway. Almost none of the jokes were funny to me anymore. Tom Hanks gives a very screeching voice performance, making Tim Allen somehow seem like the more-gifted of the two actors. And I have always had a strong frustration with the structure of this series (though I used to love this one). It's a lot of running back and forth. A lot of having a home base and being separated from it and then almost making it back and then another thing pulls you away and then back and again. It's exhausting.",negative
"A dense quasi-montage of a film that captures the history of Japanese cinema, the romance of celebrity, and an existentialist appreciation of the journey in a beautifully animated series of flashbacks, this film is the confluence of reference and reverence. It has a respect for cinema--and Japan--while also being able to depict both without canonizing them. Knowing a little (a Wikipedia entry's worth) about Setsuko Hara's life, I can see the parallels here, though I appreciate she merely served as an inspiration. Chiyoko's persona matches neatly with Hara's ""Eternal Virgin"" persona, and the appealing notion that her career was based not on a desire to create but to seek some ideal figure neatly sidesteps the seedier (and endearing) suggestions some have had about her life. The metaphor of the key also works to explain our love of celebrities. We are as much bearers of mysterious keys, seeking the chance to unlock the mysteries of the performers on our screens. It is a gentle view of celebrity worship, certainly, but it is fitting here. More than the cinephilic meta-narrative going on regarding the director and his cameraman falling into the reveries of Chiyoko, the quest to find some ideal figure and connect to them after a brief interaction serves as the perfect audience surrogate--we only have these performers for a short time, yet we obsess over them, become enthralled, devote lists, magazine articles, and fantasies to them. The mysterious painter/rebel is as much a representation of the cinematic experience as anything else in this film. I've seen a handful of Setsuko Hara films. I'm not one to obsess over performers, exactly--I have some obvious delight in gushing about them here and there, and I certainly have my lists, but you'll find no posters on my walls or Google Alerts set up--but her sad smile has haunted me since the first time I saw Tokyo Story. That this feature could evoke the power of her just by making a few references to her life says a lot about her on-screen potency, and it adds something deeply sad to this already bittersweet film. It says a lot that this film can evoke that without seeming overly ambitious.",positive
I was so bored. The way the story is told is so disjointed that I had a very hard time caring for any of the characters.

"Unlike the work of the majority of hacks who couldn't create a proper social satire if their life depended on it, Mark Waters is a masterful filmmaker with a true bite for commentary, elegantly combining a pop narrative with timeless humor to create a social critique that would make Bunuel brush. Armed with Lindsay Lohan, the Anna Karina to Waters' Godard, Waters traverses the American high school landscape, like a tiger on the prowl, effectively critiquing all the ""cliques"" one might find in such a traditional setting. The titular Mean Girls (amusingly named ""The Plastics"") may be the center target of Waters gaze, but no one in this film is perfect. Deep down, everyone is a ""Mean Girl"". Lohan, an incredibly gifted comedic actress, arms herself with a performance that is both charming and vulnerable, which allows her to be a trustworthy narrator that invites us into the world of Mean Girls. Waters also brings out great performances out of the ferocious Rachel McAdams, the underrated Lizzy Caplan, and even the worst working American actress Amanda Seyfried manages to shine in the film. Pedestrians might mistake the film's visual aesthetic as one of their own, but they would be incredibly wrong (as usual) and missing out on the pop-esque lit world that Waters sees these girls inhabiting, serving almost as an homage to the masterful Amy Heckerling. Mean Girls is by far Mark Waters' best masterpiece (in a career full of them), and one of the best, if not the best, looks into the life of a High School socialite and the conflicts that occur.",positive
"Mean Girls is a movie that explores the fragility of popularity and the dangers of relationships built on facades. The film centers around Cady Heron, a girl who grew up home-schooled in Africa and has just started attending North Shore High School. Unlike many other films, Mean Girls provides a unique twist on the classic “new girl at school” premise, quickly elevating Cady to the heights of popularity while turning viewers against her as she becomes the very thing she hates. Through Cady’s excellent character arc and a plot that becomes more interesting by the minute, Mean Girls injects a surprising amount of depth into an otherwise shallow premise. The film examines the sharp contrast between friendships based in gossip, dishonesty, and drama and friendships based in trust, kindness, and respect. It demonstrates that even small acts of unkindness can lead to much larger damage, both to individuals and entire social structures. The many moving parts in the plot all culminate in a satisfying resolution and emotional payoff. Much like the characters it portrays, however, Mean Girls often tries to be something it's not, demonstrating a lack of confidence in its own identity. Had the filmmakers focused more on its identity as a teen drama, Mean Girls would have made more of an impact on me than it did. Instead, the film dilutes itself with cringe-worthy stereotyping and flat, unnecessary humor that ruins some of the best moments in the movie. In its desperate attempts to get a laugh out of viewers, the film forgets to develop its side characters, many of whom have a lot of potential to become more than one-dimensional pawns in Cady’s story. The one exception is the character of Regina George, who fascinates me with her ability to use her cleverness to cause damage and wreak havoc on the social hierarchy of North Shore High School. As a whole, Mean Girls is a good movie that I thoroughly enjoyed watching. But it also has the potential to be so much better. Therefore, while it is certainly above average, I cannot place it in the echelons of my favorite movies.",negative
"Obviously a clockwork piece of synchronized color, choreography, and music but also just an incredibly sharp and funny industry satire that pokes fun at itself while simultaneously buying into every ludicrously romantic, fantastic image it can come up with an excuse to conjure in 100 minutes.

"(Obviously) Pixar’s very best film and (obviously) a total masterclass in screenwriting from minute one and (obviously) envisioned by the smartest American animated director currently working and (obviously) brilliant in the way it combines visual slapstick with deadpan cringe comedy and (obviously) heavily influenced by Alfred Hitchcock in both the action’s setpiece-centered thrills and in the camera’s constant deliberate motion. 

Oh, but what’s not so obvious? This is a movie about poverty and identity. It’s about the feelings of guilt and imposter syndrome and even hubris that occur when someone finally pulls their way out of squalor. It’s about the ties to your “previous life” that linger even when you’ve “made it out,” and the parts of your identity that will never change, even if your situation in life does. It’s a movie about how anyone can cook, yes, but it’s also a movie about how your origins influence who you are - and you can either embrace this fact, or try to ignore it. Linguini’s origins are undoubtedly part of his story; as the son of Gusteau, he comes from greatness, but he initially amounts to nothing. Remy the Rat, likewise, comes from nothing - but he amounts to greatness. And yet it’s only when both of them embrace their origins *and* the identities they’ve forged for themselves that they manage to find true success and joy in cooking together.",positive
"A rat wants to be a chef in Paris, he finds a bumbling human to help him achieve his dream. It's so zany and nonsensical.

I couldn't find one character I wanted to root for. It did look very pretty, especially the food and the rat scurrying animations. This must have been made firmly with kids in mind, which is a shame because usually you can count on Pixar to provide a compelling story for adult audiences as well but that's just not the case here. I don't hate Inside Out and Wall-E anymore, now i super HATE THIS FILM! It's just me but yeah, one of my least favorite. Sorry!",negative
"It’s hard to account for recency bias in saying something this definite, and surely someone will want to start a useless argument or hold resentment against the movie because they disagree, but I think this is one of my favorite movies I have ever seen. It’s been a while since I felt that way with something new. But my expectations were high going in and I still thought so 30 minutes in. Then an hour in. Then 2 hours in. Then it ended with a David Byrne and Mitski song over the credits. C’mon now. To me, this is kind of the prototypical example of what comedy can do– an idea that is inherently the silliest, most goofball of concepts, executed in the silliest, most goofball ways, leaving us disarmed and open enough that we are laughing at something, only to find ourselves saddened and emotional at the vulnerability on display in that same silly, goofball moment. There are so many moments, and even single lines that are both hilarious and truly sad because these guys are so good at taking some thing ridiculous and treating it with earnestness. It’s Interesting Ball times 1000, and it made me cry. Made several people I talked to afterwards cry! Just spectacular in every possible way? The script, the style, the costumes, the score, the editing, the fucking lighting, the performances (holy shit Ke Huy Quan!) I would watch a separate feature just about the production of this. So life-affirming and sweet and unbelievably romantic. Walked out of the theater talking about when we could see it again and feeling really thankful for the love in my life. Can’t believe I’ve already found this year’s Demi Wont Shut Up About It award winner. (As always, check back in a couple months to see if my mind has been changed to like, Aquaman 2 or some shit)",positive
"vanity elevated to a dogmatic principle, the secular smothering of any and all possible futures/pasts in favor of enthroning the ever-sacred family unit; there is no alternative permissible. a film which rejects that 'anything could happen' and insists that 'only one thing should happen'; nihilism refuted not via exceptionality, but through the omnipotence of mediocrity. synthetic edits draining filmmaking into pre-packaged gruel, all the reddit-tier 'humor' running as distraction from the fact that all of this is infused with the complicit languor of point-blank literalism; your sincerity means nothing when it's this knowingly overdetermined, this calculated, this controlled. completely one-dimensional, no subtext, barely a 'text', all structured with obvious purpose, nothing left for the performers to do but deliver canned lines of dialogue and strut into absurd frames like dolls with garish outfits. you wanted your film to look and act like this? this was your intention...? who produced this...? oh... the usual suspects. everything everywhere pacifies, waves the flag for the centrist-liberal appeasement of wanting the world to be 'nice', wanting queer people to be 'nice', wanting reality without contradiction, melancholy without anger, coffee without caffeine, the aesthetic appearance of life without any of the spontaneous potential of actually living in the world. total assimilation, where the most comforting certainties in the universe are literally death and taxes; the demonic bastard-child of the wachowskis and the MCU, with an A24 coat of paint, a cinematic tranquilizer designed to pat the audience on the back while their world burns. ""you have taken a complicated question and you have trivialized it with your answer, and lack of experience.""",negative
"With biting satire, impressive animation for it's time, loveable characters, phenomenal voice cast, gut-busting funny writing, and a refreshingly honest message, Shrek is one brilliant and unique animated flick for the whole family that casts a spell over us with its charm and inventiveness. This film will always be apart of my childhood.",positive
"You know what? If Shrek played it straight without the snarky, condescending jabs at Disney and all of the empty allusions and references, it would be a good movie. Because the bones of this thing are solid. Whenever this is focusing on someone who wants to be loved, but is too wounded to let anyone in, Shrek is quite moving. And yet, for a movie about how appearances don't matter, it sure does make a lot of superficial jokes. The fact that this movie makes so many short jokes for no reason, and whose cleverest idea is naming its antagonist Lord Farquaad (get it? Because it sounds like ""fuckwad""?). The movie, not just the characters, is constantly making a mockery of these fairy tales and then it wants to be taken seriously as a fairy tale. It wants its layer cake and to eat it, too. Beyond that, it looks like dog shit. Donkey is grating as fuck, seemingly on purpose. The soundtrack is gimmicky and meandering. This movie is as embarrassing of an achievement as it is of fairy tales and Disney. I hate how this started the trend of trying to make kids movies smarter by making them meaner and grosser. Shrek is so vulgar and profane. It is a blight on pop culture, and we are worse off for it.",negative
"i am just a kid. i've only been into movies for about 8 months and i know i have found my calling, my passion, and my life. in 10 years, will i still be insane and watch a movie every single day? will i still go to the cinema with my best friend and my mom? will i still spend all of my money of DVDs, just dreaming of having my own collection? i really hope so. cause this community, these movies, this life, is exactly what i want. there is nothing i want more. i love everything about it. i love what movies give people. not only do they give me a good laugh, tears, a smile, but they bring me you. letterboxd has become my favorite thing to do. it's a perfect yet flawed community of people who care about the same thing. whether your favorite movie is pulp fiction or the room, everyone can be (somewhat) accepted here. this ""essay"" has gotten off task, but i just really wanted to talk about how much movies have shaped my and hopefully your life. never stop watching movies, whether they have 1 star on netflix or a 100 on rotten tomatoes. never let people tell you what movies to like or what to make of movies. i hope in 10 years letterboxd will be around so we can continue to enjoy cinema together.",positive
"Morricone, bless you. Even in a movie this putrid and painfully uninspired, he managed one of the great theme tunes. Giuseppe Tornatore could have saved us from a lot of his bullshit if the kissing montage at the end was all he had, because frankly, the rest of the film is an unbelievable, badly acted piece of sentimentality porn which wears glasses so rose-tinted that anyone not in tune with his vision could mistake those roses for blood. Jesus fucking Christ, this was unbearable. Toto the kid is one of the least sympathetic kids ever, and the movie tries to cover it up because of his love of the movies. Because NOTHING in the world could possibly be more important than movies and the cinema, right? Who needs education, or discipline, or empathy, or the safety of others? Taking a random video of a random girl in public is perfectly fine, because HE LOVES MOVIES. Persistently lying to his parents, stealing from Alfredo, and doing great harm to his sister - that's all fine as well because HE LOVES MOVIES. This movie also tries to convince us that a raucous crowd-mentality, an encouragement of piracy by theatres, pollution of the streets, among other things are also somehow fine. There's a fucking scene where some dimwits in the front row are masturbating to the screen, and besides a laughably weak slap or two, the guard largely lets them off. But this is all fine too, because this is the MAGIC OF THE MOVIES(TM). This movie is just utterly delusional - it adds importance to movies and the movie-going experience, because by doing that, it adds importance to itself by proxy, as it is a movie about movies and the movie-going experience. What a lazy and horseshit anti-art approach - it comes close to the nadir of creativity. It's not a coincidence that the vast majority of the actually watchable segments in ""Cinema Paradiso"" come from footage of the older movies themselves. Even in their shortened form, they still exhibit more creativity, wit and soul than this. This film abuses nostalgia in the worst possible way because aside from the final sequence (in which Morricone does so much of the heavy-lifting), Tornatore brings nothing interesting to the table. His directorial decisions are baffling to say the least. The army scene isn't long enough, the waiting outside the window has only a thread-bare relationship with the story Alfredo tells, and some scenes are so fucking corny that I can't tell if it's meant to be reality or a badly put together fantasy sequence. The atrocious writing doesn't help with matters, either. Perhaps some of this is remedied in the extended versions (I saw the two hour cut), but frankly, I don't want to put myself through this again. It felt like the 172 minute cut while watching it. I'd be more forgiving of this film if it were either a) better written, or b) not so reliant on the classic movies shown. It doesn't say anything about those older movies because so much of ""Cinema Paradiso"" is reaction shots of badly behaved theatre goers (ironically, while trying to advertise the magic of the movies, this film exposes everything that is wrong with theatres and theatre audiences). Seriously, large sections of this movie are an extended THEATRE-GOERS POST-WWII REACT TO OLD MOVIES skit which is extremely painful to watch due to just how little cinema etiquette is demonstrated. And yet the movie appears just fine with it. Because it's the MAGIC OF THE MOVIES(TM). I love the cinema, but get fucking real.",negative
"Emotion with a capital E. Brad Bird takes the concept of ET and transforms the consumerist setting of the 80s into a paranoiac painting of the 1950s. Every aspect revolves around the fuzzy, strange, and complex feelings radiating from the heart, and Fall shifts into Winter within 30 seconds because it's a flourishing aspect of the film's operatic humanism. The end feels like a sly way to contradict its inner themes without drawing criticism, and it's a shame because until then, The Iron Giant is extraordinary in its grandiose cold-war analysis and bittersweet connection. Also, stop doing Superman movies. We have this one and it's all we need.",positive
"UFO. The direction by Brad Bird is good. The screenplay is poor, with tons of clichés and dumb character choices. These characters might the dumbest characters ever. The villains were ridiculously dumb. I hate films like this where antagonists are dumb and not smart. I’ve seen this mostly in children and family films and hated it as a child. I yelled at the film for character’s stupidity in situations. The voice acting was fine, but some voices didn’t match the character designs or audio sounded awful. The animation is solid and the highlight of the film. The score is fine, with the period music working. Messy animated film that was a massive disappointment for me",negative
This might be on of the best romance screenplays ever written. The concept Is so original and truly engaging which put me in somewhat of a dream like state myself. The visuals are absolutely brilliant and it might just be one of the best looking animations I have ever seen. The world building of the little town and the city landscape of Tokyo is fantastically done and it really helps you connect with the main characters journeys. Such an out there and complex concept which could have easily had so many issues but after the first watch I am struggling to find much at all. I definitely understand the hype with this but even still it somehow managed to exceed my expectations. This is also coming from someone who is definitely not an avid Anime watcher and actually the first one that I have seen outside Studio Ghibli.,positive
"While I do think there is a lot to love about this movie, unfortunately it just didn’t work for me overall. I think where it exceeds is obviously the insanely gorgeous visuals, the fun music, and just the overall cute romantic vibe. But it wasn’t really much to me beyond a cute story. I’ve seen plenty of romances and in comparison I just didn’t see anything that made this stand out or made me care about their particular relationship. The science fiction aspect is cool but also leads to my biggest issue with the film. I take issues with consent very seriously and it really impacts how I will personally feel about a film. And this film is VERY flippant with it’s approach to it. The way Taki non-consensually explores Mitsuha’s body is gross and it’s gross that this film 1. acknowledges that he shouldn’t be doing that and then 2. has him do it anyway while playing it for jokes. It downplays the issue in a big way that’s lazy and irresponsible.",negative
"This is pure cinematic magic. Each scene is perfectly constructed with beauty, filled with positive energy and graced with stunning music. The way its shot is expressive, gleeful and hard to not look at. Every song is perfect. They each match the tone perfectly, are sang perfectly and are perfect to listen to. Each character is fun in their own way. It’s just a wonderful experience I come back to every year, magical.",positive
"Every year cinephiles struggle to find a film that reminds them exactly why they love cinema. The exact type of film differs from person to person, and what you look for can constantly change from year to year. But you know those films when you find them, because there's that feeling you get. You sit there with your heart and mind open. Nothing else matters. You begin to reflect on yourself and your life, and how the film relates to you. As the credits roll, you let go of your breath, as if you had been holding it in the entire time. This year, I have found that film in Ang Lee's Life of Pi. It is the film that gives me that almost religious and spiritual experience that I die for every time I go see a film, and one Life of Pi delivered which such reassurance, I left the theater feeling warm and optimistic. I won't go into details of the film's story, because that would give away everything that makes this film special. All I can say is that it is about a boy stuck on a lifeboat with a tiger. That's all. To say anymore would ruin the experience. All I can say is that Ang Lee handles the film well, and he makes what was said to be an unfilmable novel look so easy. The film's newcoming actor Suraj Sharma is great, and he works well considering he's all alone since the Tiger is CGI. And speaking of tiger, I've never seen seamless CGI like this. I went in knowing it was CGI, but the whole film I couldn't tell the difference. I'm not going to exalt Life of Pi as being a flawless masterpiece. I'm sure there were flaws, but I couldn't be bothered to care or even notice them. Life of Pi is currently my film of the year, merely because it gave me that spiritual experience I'm always looking for, and if you're open to it, hopefully it will find you too.",positive
"This film tells me that God is the greatest story ever made up, religion is a selfish thing and keeps people apart, to truely understand and accept something unbelievable you have to completely shut down logic and reason, and you should never be angry at God for killing or hurting everyone around you, you can actually learn something from witnessing your entire family get killed, forgive Him for it and even be glad it happened, like Pi. Was that what I was supposed to learn from this film? If Life of Pi was made as a device to convert people to believe or see the beauty of faith, then well done, I won't ever even consider now. If it was made to amaze me, show me how beautiful the world is, life and nature, try something better than 3d CGI fish.",negative
"Wow. I already had high expectations for this film before seeing it, but I can gladly say my expectations were exceeded. This animated extravaganza puts all recent kids films to shame with it's breathtaking visuals, exciting set-pieces, and a huge amount of laughs. Now, the story itself isn't THAT original, but the way it all plays out is honestly the best anyone could have asked for. The characters are all really likeable and help out guide the story as well. A few standouts are the 1980's Spaceman (Charlie Day) and Bad Cop (Liam Neeson). But, almost everyone in this movie is hilarious, so finding standouts were particularly hard. Especially when Batman is in the movie. Not only does the film take its generic kids story and turn it into something much better due to its execution and performances, it also changes how it handles the ""kids"" humor. This is one of those cases where this film might be as enjoyable for the adults as is it for the kids just because the humor and comedic timing is just SO GOOD. I expected to laugh during this, but not like I ended up doing. A certain cameo had my whole audience in stitches and even got some guy behind me to yell ""Dude, this is funnier than Anchorman 2!"" Take that as you will. He was probably drunk as well. I can honestly say The LEGO Movie is my favorite kids film since Toy Story 3 back in 2010 and one of my all time favorites from the genre as well. Directors Phil Lord and Chris Miller have been on my radar because of Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs and 21 Jump Street, but they easily outdo both of those movies here. This duo has a bright future ahead of them if they keep it up. Despite being only February, this could have a shot at being in my top ten when the year ends. It's that good.",positive
